# Protein rollup

Quantify (roll up) your peptide-level data to the protein level.  Here you will specify the various parameters required to perform protein rollup.  

## BP-Quant
If you have performed peptide statistics and wish to account for protein isoforms, first panel on the left has options to run BP-Quant.  This involves selecting which comparisons to use in the calculation, and a threshold for the maximum number of valid protein isoforms, see (Webb-Robertson et al. 2014) for more details.

## Rollup options

Options for how to perform protein rollup include the roll-up method, which determines how to select peptide values that contribute to the protein abundance values, a centering function, and whether to use the protein isoforms that you have (optionaly) calculated.

When satisfied, press the 'Roll up' button and wait for a modal indicating that all went well.
