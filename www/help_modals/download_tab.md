# Download Results

You can download the results of your session in this tab.  Inspect saved plots, tables, and choose which ones to download (all of them by default).  

**Plots:**  In the top panel, if you have saved any plots during your session, they will appear in a table; click an entry in the table to see a preview of the plot.  You can deselect/select plots or remove them from the list using the buttons below the table.

**Data tables:**  Various spreadsheets with the processed values of your data (e.g. log transformed and normalized), statistical results, and sample/biomolecule information will be displayed in a table in the second expandable panel.  You can select which spreadsheets to download by clicking on them and using the button to include/exclude them from the download.

**Bundle and download:**  Once you have selected the plots and spreadsheets you want to download, click the 'Bundle up all selected items' button to package up the results into a compressed archive.  Once successful, the 'Download bundle' button will become available; click it to download the results.

## Report

Additionally, you can create and download an html report describing the processing steps you took. This report can be produced in the final collapsible panel.  You can give the file a name and then click "Make report" to download the report as an html document.  This will include details about all the preprocessing and analysis steps you took during your session.
