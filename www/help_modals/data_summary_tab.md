# Preview Your Data

This tab contains some useful plots to visualize your data before proceeding to filtering and normalization.  You can view the following:

1.  Boxplots of uploaded data.
2.  Barplots and scatterplots showing the distribution of missing values in your data.
3.  Plots of samples by their principal components.

You can save each plot for later download via the 'Save last plot' button in the top right.  There is nothing to be done to your data on this page, continue to filtering or normalization once you are done.
