# Statistics at the Peptide Level

This tab is for running statistical analyses on peptide-level proteomics data.  Currently we only support the iMd-ANOVA group comparison method.  The results of this analysis are used to perform isoform identification with BPQuant on the protein rollup tab.  You will roughly do the following:

1.  Select your analysis method via the dropdown.
2.  For most analyses, select the group comparisons you want to perform.  You can select all comparisons, control to test, or user specified comparisons.  Additional menus/tables requesting information about the comparisons will appear depending on your selection.
3.  Fill out any additional settings such as whether to apply one or both types of statistical tests for iMd-ANOVA, or which multiple comparison adjustments to apply.
4.  Click the blue button at the bottom of the left column to perform the analysis.  If all goes well, a modal indicating success will appear and plots/tables of your results will become available in the right-side panels.
